To run the application is quite easy.

The full deployment with library installation will work with this two commands. 

- ''npm start'' to run the development version.

- ''npm run deploy'' to run the production version. If the web opens but the app is not running yet, you just need to refresh the page. 

Both will open directly Chrome in the port 5000, please sure the port is free.


Any problem please let me know.

Thanks.
